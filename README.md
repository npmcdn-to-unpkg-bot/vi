# Visual Intrigue Source Code

## About
This is the source code for the visual intrigue project.  It is the project code used to run [Visual Intrigue]|(http://visualintrigue.com), my 
photography blog
The code is all written in python flask.  At the time of this writing it is a very ugly mess and I will eventually upgrade it
use the blueprint framework.  But for now, until this refactor happens, this is the unfortunate state of this project.  I have
learned a lot about flask and hope to continue to build on my 15 years of PHP experience.  

# Notable Features
- Responsive design using the latest twitter bootstrap 4 (yes, i know it is alpha code)
- Mobile first, everything looks nice on your phone
- Lightweight, not a lot of bloat
- Uses Amazon S3 for image storage, but can be adapted to use Amazon cloud front
- Uses mongodb to help reduce the number of backend queries to the database
