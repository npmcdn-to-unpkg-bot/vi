<h4>Biograpy</h4>
<p>
    Visual Intrigue is the home of photography for Randall Svancara.  Based out of Seattle, Randall travels the Pacific
    Northwest taking photos.  Randall's interest in photography started with a recommendation of a co-worker, Bruce Kinkead to learn photography on a Pentax k1000,
    a very simple film camera with match needle exposure. The Pentax K1000 was a simple camera, but provided a great platform to learn the basics
    of photography. From this simple platform, Randall's passion for landscape photography evolved and continues to evolve with every new adventure. We hope you enjoy
    this site.

<h4>About This Site</h4>
<p>Ok, this is the section where I get on my soap box and talk about Visual Intrigue.  The site started off as a
platform to post my photography, but later became more of a place of experimentation where I could hone my
skills at web development and attempt to create a trully unique web experience for anyone who visited the site.
</p>
<p>My design goals for the site are clear:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide a trully unique visual experience</li>
    <li>Layout the content in an intuitive manor</li>
    <li>Provide the ability to create rich stories</li>
    <li>Lastly, yes my hobby costs money, but provide less intrusive adverstising...a lofty goal for sure</li>
</ul>
<p>First let's go over what is wrong with most photography blogs today.  It seems that most of them are
are based on Wordpress.  And to be fair, Wordpress is a great platform, however I feel it lacks something...what could it be??
Well for one, it lacks creativity.  Content is laid out in a linear fashion, one post or page at a time.  It is the same
recipe over and over.  It is like everyone only buying the same house with the same floor plan over and over, and all you can do is change the color and fill it 
with different furniture.  While it is predictable, it has conditioned users to expect the same thing and lacks any sort of creativity or opportunity
to innovate.  Furthermore, it has resulted in situations where more often than not, it is unable to satisfy all the use cases that is expected of the platform.
</p>
<p>Visual Intrigue aims to be different; lots of images, mobile friendly, rich content and most of all unique. While
I do not intentionally target Wordpress, I simply use Wordpress as an example of what I think creates challenges for creative people.</p>
<p>Additionally, on a more technical, behind the scenes level, content management solutions, like Wordpress or Drupal are fraught with problems.  First of all,
they are actually slow in terms of performance.  If you don't believe me, go to <a href="http://www.stuckincustoms.com/">Stuck in Customs</a>, one of
my favorite travel blogs and look at the load time of the pages.  Humans are latency sensitive creatures, especially when caffeinated.  One second
page loads are a necessity these days.  Most major website providers know this and use many techniques to make this happen however many traditional content management solutions
still have challenges with this.  Why you ask?  When you start
to decompose all the parts of a webpage, Wordpress and Drupal are not optimized properly.  First they rely on slow, traditional databases
like MySQL or Postgresql which, I happen to love both technologies, they however do not scale properly and to make matters even worse, a single page may require thirty or more individual queries.  At 10 milliseconds per query, you have lost 200 milliseconds of the one second page load time.  While caching does help, it creates necessary complexity.  One of the design goals of Visual Intrigue aims to reduce
technological complexity while creating a more robust user experience.  This includes many performance improvements over traditional solutions like Wordpress or Drupal.</p>
<p>Now to be fair, I have worked with Drupal and Wordpress for many years and at one time worked for <a href="http://www.stuckincustoms.com/">Stuck in Customs</a>, where
became intimately familiar with the challenges of Wordpress.  Additionally I have worked with PHP since 2001.  While all these technologies have been instrumental in
allowing people to publish content on the web and become wildly successful in their respective business ventures, the problem remains, these sites are just plain slow.  
</p>
<p>In conclusion, I simply endeavor to create a robust end user experience using the best of breed technologies and modern standards.  Feel free to drop me a line if you have questions or concerns.</p>
